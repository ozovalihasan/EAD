Entity Association Diagram
==========================

This documentation explains how to use EAD(Entity Association Diagram )

After reading this document, you will know:

* How to generate associations for Ruby on Rails

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Types of Associations
-------------------------

EAD supports five types of associations:

* [`belongs_to`][]
* [`has_one`][]
* [`has_many`][]
* [`has_many :through`][`has_many`]
* [`has_one :through`][`has_one`]


In the remainder of this documentation, you'll learn how to declare and use the various forms of associations. But first, a quick introduction to the situations where each association type is appropriate.

[`belongs_to`]: https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods.html#method-i-belongs_to
[`has_many`]: https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods.html#method-i-has_many
[`has_one`]: https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods.html#method-i-has_one

### The `belongs_to` Association

belongs_to association is added automatically.
