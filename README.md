# EAD (Entity Association Diagram)

EAD is a tool to initialize any Ruby on Rails project quickly by implementing associations from a generated JSON file.

EAD contains two parts;

- A user interface(called 'EAD') to generate JSON file
- A gem(called 'EAD gem' or 'ead') to modify the files of a Ruby on Rails project by using the generated JSON file

This repository contains the code of the user interface.

EAD gem can be accessible from [this repository](https://github.com/ozovalihasan/ead-g) or [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org/gems/ead)

## Built With

- React
- react-beautiful-dnd
- Redux Toolkit
- styled-components
- Jest

## Getting Started

Preparing ERD is the first step of any Ruby on Rails project. But, implementing ERD to a Ruby on Rails project can be time-consuming and repetitive. 

More, arrows are used to represent associations on ERD. It can be hard to follow these arrows if any entity has a lot of relations.

EAD is designed to solve these two problems. Firstly, EAD is using blocks moved by the drag-and-drop gesture. Any block can be collided and expanded. It allows reading associations by going from top to bottom easily(this order may change for advanced blocks.).

Secondly, a JSON file can be produced by using EAD quickly and this JSON file can be implemented into a Ruby on Rails project by EAD gem. So, any project can be started with ready associations without consuming any time.

EAD is not an intermediate step between ERD and the process of adding associations. EAD is developed to be used instead of ERD.
### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Firefox or Chrome is suggested).
- A new Ruby on Rails project

### Usage

EAD can be accessible with any modern browser. To learn how to use EAD, check [this document](./documents/how-to-use.md). A JSON file should be generated by the clicking 'Download EAD' button when all associations are ready. 

Install EAD gem by running `gem install ead`.

Then, there are two choices to use the generated JSON file;
- Run `ead 'path_of_the_generated_file'` in the root folder of your Ruby on Rails project. Don't forget to put quotation marks(').
- Move the generated JSON file (its name must be 'EAD.json') to the root folder of your project and run `ead`. 

‚ö†Ô∏è: Save your files before running the gem.

‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è: Please double-check generated files by the gem.

‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è: EAD is still under development. So, it is not recommended to use this gem with ongoing projects. 


- If all files are generated as expected, run `bundle exec rails db:migrate`.

- Three [videos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PrS0zW3H-ZKMjhHDAXTN2vRz-flhLDdE?usp=sharing) are provided as example. If you want to check videos for previous versions, please check [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PrS0zW3H-ZKMjhHDAXTN2vRz-flhLDdE?usp=sharing).
### Features

- All related buttons of a block is shown when the cursor is hovering on ![plus](./documents/images/plus.png).
- Any block can be collided by using ![collide button](./documents/images/collide.png) and expanded ![expand button](./documents/images/expand.png).
- Blocks in another block can be aligned vertically by using ![vertical button](./documents/images/align-vertical.png) and horizontally by using ![horizontal button](./documents/images/align-horizontal.png).
- Any drop area can be chosen to work by using flag (checkbox without flag ![flag-uncheck](./documents/images/flag-uncheck.png) and with flag ![flag-check](./documents/images/flag-check.png) ).
  * Selected blocks' color is ![blue-selected](./documents/images/blue-selected.png).
- All enabled blocks can be moved with a move cursor ![move-enable](./documents/images/move-enable.png). Disabled blocks cannot be moved(![move-disable](./documents/images/move-disable.png)). Also, each block can be moved with other blocks inside of them.
  * Enabled blocks' color can be any of ![blue-1](./documents/images/blue-1.png) ![orange](./documents/images/orange.png) ![white](./documents/images/white.png).
  * The color of disabled blocks and drop areas is ![gray](./documents/images/gray.png).
  * The color of coupled dragged blocks and drop areas is ![yellow](./documents/images/yellow.png).
  * The color of dragged blocks being removed is ![red](./documents/images/red.png).
- A clone of any entity can be added into the selected block by using ![clone](./documents/images/clone.png). The color of clone entities is ![orange](./documents/images/orange.png). If a clone button is shown next to a cloned block, another clone of the real block of the cloned block can be added into the selected block.
- Any block can be added into the selected block by using ![departure](./documents/images/departure.png). An allowed block can be added into selected block by using ![arrival](./documents/images/arrival.png).
- Any block can be deleted by using ![delete](./documents/images/delete.png).
- 'has_many' association can be added by using ![has_many](./documents/images/has_many.png).
- 'has_one' association can be added by using ![has_one](./documents/images/has_one.png).
- ':through' association can be added by using ![through](./documents/images/through.png).
- Any EAD file can be uploaded by hovering on "Upload EAD" and selecting a file.
- EAD can be used in compact mode by clicking the 'Compact Mode' button. Compact mode hides almost all buttons to provide an presentation.
- EAD can be reset to the initial state by clicking the 'Reset' button.
- EAD can be saved to localStorage by clicking the 'Save' button.
- EAD can be installed with data from localStorage by clicking the 'Install Saved Data' button.
- All blocks can be expanded by clicking the 'Expand All' button.

‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è: EAD allows to use of any drag blocks and drop areas by default. But, it is suggested to select a drop area with the flag ![flag-check](./documents/images/flag-check.png) and then drag any enabled block.

## Run EAD locally

- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm start`

## Test EAD

- Clone this repository
- Open terminal
- Change directory by using `cd ead`
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm test` to test all files
